# Classic Arcade Game Project

## This is the third project from Udacity Nanodegree Program
This project represent the arcade game built with Javascript, css and html. Some of the resources were provided by Udacity (resources.js and engine.js).

> To play the game you have to control the character on keyboard with the arrows.

## Game Rules
1. Try to reach the "Water" without collision with any bug.
2. You can try just 3 times if you touch the bug.
3. If you arrive to the water you will win 100 points.

## How to run the project locally
To run this game locally you need to download the repo and load index.html to the browser.

## Great experience
On this project I used object-orientated javascript. I learned how to make animation and making objects to move automatic.
