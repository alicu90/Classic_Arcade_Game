Classic Arcade Game Project
===============================

## This is the third project from Udacity Nanodegree Program

This project represent the arcade game built with Javascript, css and html. Some of the resources were provided by Udacity (resources.js and engine.js).

## Great experience

On this project I used object-orientated javascript. I learned how to make animation and making objects to move automatic.
